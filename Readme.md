The *FlexMeasures Platform* is a tool for building real-time energy flexibility services, rapidly and scalable. 

- Developing energy flexibility services (e.g. to enable demand response) is crucial, but expensive.
- FlexMeasures reduces development costs with real-time data integrations, uncertainty models and API/UI support.

The role of FlexMeasures is to enhance the services of energy service companies (ESCOs) towards energy flexibility. For instance, forecasts and schedules are made available via API (designed with [the USEF framework](https://usef.energy) in mind). Uncertainty about ongoing events is modelled accurately and for a decentralised eco-system with the [timely-beliefs framework](https://github.com/SeitaBV/timely-beliefs).

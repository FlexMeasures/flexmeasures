Dashboard

The dashboard shows where the user's assets are located and how many different asset types are connected to the platform.
The view serves to quickly identify the status of assets, such as whether there are upcoming opportunities to valorise on flexibility activations.
In particular, the page contains:

    :align: center

.. _dashboard_map:

Interactive map of assets
=========================

The map shows all of the user's assets with icons for each asset type.
Hovering over an asset allows users to see its name and ownership, and clicking on an asset allows the user to navigate to its page to see more details, for instance forecasts.


.. _dashboard_summary:

Summary of asset types
======================

The summary below the map lists all asset types that the user has hooked up to the platform and how many of each there are.
Clicking on the asset type name leads to the asset's page, where its data is shown.


Grouping by accounts
=====================

.. note:: This is a feature for user with role ``admin`` or ``admin-reader``.

By default, the map is layered by asset type. However, on the bottom right admins can also switch to grouping by accounts.
Then, map layers will contain the assets owned by accounts, and you can easily see who you're serving with what.

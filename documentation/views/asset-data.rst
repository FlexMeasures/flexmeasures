The asset page allows to see data from the asset's sensors, and also to edit meta information, like its location:

.. note:: It is possible to determine which sensors this page should show. For instance, here we include a price sensor from a public asset.
          For this, set the `sensors_to_show` attribute with the CLI command ``flexmeasures edit attribute``.

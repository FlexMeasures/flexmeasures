Flexibility opportunities
*****************

Flexibility opportunities have commercial value that users can valorise on.
When FlexMeasures has identified commercial value for flexibility opportunities, the user is suggested to act on them.
This might happen manually (operators seeing opportunities in the FlexMeasures UI) or in an automated fashion
(scripts reading out suggested flexible schedules from the FlexMeasures API and implementing them to local operations if possible).

In the Flexibility opportunities page (a yet-to-be designed feature discussed below), FlexMeasures shows all flexibility opportunities that the user can take for a selected time window.

Types of flexibility opportunities
==========================

The platform distinguishes between different types of flexibility opportunities and the type of action to take advantage of it.

Curtailment
-----------

Curtailment happens when an asset temporarily lowers or stops its production or consumption.
A defining feature of curtailment is that total production or consumption at the end of the flexibility opportunity has decreased.

- A typical example of curtailing production is when a wind turbine adjusts the pitch angle of its blades to decrease the generator torque.
- An example of curtailing consumption is load shedding of energy intensive industries.

Curtailment offers may specify some freedom in terms of how much energy can be curtailed.
In these cases, the user can select the energy volume (in MWh) to be ordered, within constraints set by the relevant Prosumer.
The net effect of a curtailment action is also measured in terms of an energy volume (see the flexibility metrics in the :ref:`portfolio` page).
Note that the volume ordered is not necessarily equal to the volume curtailed:
the ordered volume relates only to the selected time window,
while the curtailed volume may include volumes outside of the selected time window.
For example, an asset that runs an all-or-nothing consumption process of 2 hours can be ordered to curtail consumption for 1 hour, but will in effect stop the entire process.
In this case, the curtailed volume will be higher than the ordered volume, and the platform will take into account the total expected curtailment in its calculations.

Shifting
--------

Shifting happens when an asset delays or advances its energy production or consumption.
A defining feature of shifting is that total production or consumption at the end of the flexibility opportunity remains the same.

- An example of delaying consumption is when a charging station postpones the charging process of an electric vehicle.
- An example of advancing consumption is when a cooling unit starts to cool before the upper temperature bound was reached (pre-cooling).

Shifting offers may specify some freedom in terms of how much energy can be shifted.
In these cases, the user can select the energy volume (in MWh) to be ordered, within constraints set by the relevant Prosumer.
This energy volume represents how much energy is shifting into or out of the selected time window.
The net effect of a shifting action is measured in terms of an energy-time volume (see the flexibility metrics in the :ref:`portfolio` page).
This volume is a multiplication of the energy volume being shifted and the duration of that shift.


Visualisation of opportunities
========================

Visualising flexibility opportunities and their effects is not straightforward.

Here is a potential UX design which we have not implemented yet:

    :align: center
..    :scale: 40%

Flexibility opportunities cause changes to the power profile of an asset.
Such effects could be taken into account by FlexMeasures and shown to the user, e.g. as a part of expected value calculations and power profile forecasts.

An example how this could look like is below.
The operator can select flexibility opportunities which have a value attached to them and see the effects on the power profile in a visual manner.

Listed flexibility opportunities include previously realised opportunities and currently offered opportunities.
Currently offered opportunties are presented as an order book, where they are sorted according to their commercial value.

Of course, depending on the time window selection and constraints set by the asset owner, the effects of an opportunity may partially take place outside of the selected time window.

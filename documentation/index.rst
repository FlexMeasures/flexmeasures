Welcome to the FlexMeasures documentation!
===================================================================

In a world with renewable energy, flexibility is crucial and valuable.
Planning ahead allows flexible assets to serve the whole system with their flexibility,
e.g. by shifting or curtailing energy use.
This can also be profitable for their owners.

The FlexMeasures Platform is a tool for scheduling flexible actions for energy assets.
For this purpose, it performs three services:

* Monitoring of incoming measurements
* Forecasting of expected measurements
* Scheduling flexible actions with custom optimization

For more on FlexMeasures services, read :ref:`services`.

.. _docker-compose:

Running a complete stack with docker-compose
=============================================

To install FlexMeasures, plus the libraries and databases it depends on, on your computer is some work, and can have unexpected hurdles, e.g. depending on the operating system. A nice alternative is to let that happen within Docker. The whole stack can be run via `Docker compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_, saving the developer much time.

For this, we assume you are in the directory housing ``docker-compose.yml``.


.. note:: The minimum Docker version is 17.09 and for docker-compose we tested successfully at version 1.25. You can check your versions with ``docker[-compose] --version``.

.. note:: The command might also be ``docker compose`` (no dash), for instance if you are using `Docker Desktop <https://docs.docker.com/desktop>`_.

Build the compose stack
------------------------

Run this:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose build

This pulls the images you need, and re-builds the FlexMeasures ones from code. If you change code, re-running this will re-build that image.

This compose script can also serve as an inspiration for using FlexMeasures in modern cloud environments (like Kubernetes). For instance, you might want to not build the FlexMeasures image from code, but simply pull the image from DockerHub.

If you wanted, you could stop building from source, and directly use the official flexmeasures image for the server and worker container
(set ``image: lfenergy/flexmeasures`` in the file ``docker-compose.yml``).


Run the compose stack
----------------------

Start the stack like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose up

.. warning:: This might fail if ports 5000 (Flask) or 6379 (Redis) are in use on your system. Stop these processes before you continue.

Check ``docker ps`` or ``docker-compose ps`` to see if your containers are running:


.. code-block:: console

    ± docker ps

The FlexMeasures server container has a health check implemented, which is reflected in this output and you can see which ports are available on your machine to interact.

You can use the terminal or ``docker-compose logs`` to look at output. ``docker inspect <container>`` and ``docker exec -it <container> bash`` can be quite useful to dive into details. 
We'll see the latter more in this tutorial.


Configuration
---------------

You can pass in your own configuration (e.g. for MapBox access token, or db URI, see below) like we described in :ref:`docker_configuration` ― put a file ``flexmeasures.cfg`` into a local folder called ``flexmeasures-instance`` (the volume should be already mapped).


Data
-------

The postgres database is a test database with toy data filled in when the flexmeasures container starts.
You could also connect it to some other database (on your PC, in the cloud), by setting a different ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` in the config. 


.. _docker-compose-tutorial:

Seeing it work: Running the toy tutorial
--------------------------------------

A good way to see if these containers work well together, and maybe to inspire how to use them for your own purposes, is the :ref:`tut_toy_schedule`.

The `flexmeasures-server` container already creates the toy account when it starts (see its initial command). We'll now walk through the rest of the toy tutorial, with one twist at the end, when we create the battery schedule.

Let's go into the `flexmeasures-worker` container:

.. code-block:: console

    docker exec -it flexmeasures-worker-1 bash

There, we add the price data, as described in :ref:`tut_toy_schedule_price_data`. Create the prices and add them to the FlexMeasures DB in the container's bash session.

Next, we put a scheduling job in the worker's queue. This only works because we have the Redis container running ― the toy tutorial doesn't have it. The difference is that we're adding ``--as-job``:

.. code-block:: console

    flexmeasures add schedule --sensor-id 2 --optimization-context-id 3 \
        --start ${TOMORROW}T07:00+01:00 --duration PT12H --soc-at-start 50% \
        --roundtrip-efficiency 90% --as-job

We should now see in the output of ``docker logs flexmeasures-worker-1`` something like the following:

.. code-block:: console

    Running Scheduling Job d3e10f6d-31d2-46c6-8308-01ede48f8fdd: <Sensor 2: charging, unit: MW res.: 0:15:00>, from 2022-07-06 07:00:00+01:00 to 2022-07-06 19:00:00+01:00

So the job had been queued in Redis, was then picked up by the worker process, and the result should be in our SQL database container. Let's check!

We'll not go into the server container this time, but simply send a command:

.. code-block:: console

    TOMORROW=$(date --date="next day" '+%Y-%m-%d')
    docker exec -it flexmeasures-server-1 bash -c "flexmeasures show beliefs --sensor-id 2 --start ${TOMORROW}T07:00:00+01:00 --duration PT12H"

The charging/discharging schedule should be there:

.. code-block:: console

Like in the original toy tutorial, we can also check in the server container's `web UI <http://localhost:5000/sensors/2/>`_ (username is "toy-user@flexmeasures.io", password is "toy-password"):

Scripting with the Docker stack
----------------------------------

A very important aspect of this stack is if it can be put to interesting use.
For this, developers need to be able to script things ― like we just did with the toy tutorial.

Note that instead of starting a console in the containers, we can also send commands to them right away.
For instance, we sent the complete ``flexmeasures show beliefs`` command and then viewed the output on our own machine.
Likewise, we send the ``pytest`` command to run the unit tests (see below).

Used this way, and in combination with the powerful list of :ref:`cli`, this FlexMeasures Docker stack is scriptable for interesting applications and simulations!


Running tests
---------------

You can run tests in the flexmeasures docker container, using the database service ``test-db`` in the compose file (per default, we are using the ``dev-db`` database service).

After you've started the compose stack with ``docker-compose up``, run:

.. code-block:: console

    docker exec -it -e SQLALCHEMY_TEST_DATABASE_URI="postgresql://fm-test-db-user:fm-test-db-pass@test-db:5432/fm-test-db" flexmeasures-server-1 pytest

This rounds up the dev experience offered by running FlexMeasures in Docker. Now you can develop FlexMeasures and also run your tests. If you develop plugins, you could extend the command being used, e.g. ``bash -c "cd /path/to/my/plugin && pytest"``.

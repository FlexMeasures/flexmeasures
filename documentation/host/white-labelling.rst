White-labeling FlexMeasures
===========================

In :ref:`plugin_customization`, we described how you can make FlexMeasures look diffferent, in logo, favicon or style.

You can also adapt the looks for your clients, though.
Each account can be edited, so that they use their own logo URL, as well as primary and secondary colors.

Here you see an example how that might look:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlexMeasures/screenshots/main/screenshot-whitelabelling.png
    :align: center
..    :scale: 40%


These styles will be applied when users of this account log in and browse the FlexMeasures UI.
When they do not have unique account settings, but their consultancy account has, they will see the custom style of their consultant.

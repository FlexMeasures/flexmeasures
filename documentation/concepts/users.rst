Who can use the platform?
=========================

Various parties might be beneficiaries of using the FlexMeasures platform, and services built on top of it.
Listed below are a few types, listed by their role in the Universal Smart Energy Framework (USEF), which are supported as account roles (see :ref:`auth`).


Prosumers
---------

Prosumers are owners of assets that are connected to the electricity grid and can produce and/or consume energy (like buildings, wind turbines, charging stations for electric vehicles). A part of these assets consists of Active Demand & Supply (ADS), which are assets that have some flexibility in their load or generation. This flexibility can be activated by the Prosumer itself, or given the Prosumer's consent, by a third party.

A Prosumer can use FlexMeasures to sell flexibility services.


Suppliers
---------
A Supplier is a company that has a contractual relationship with Prosumers to source, supply and invoice energy.

A Supplier can use FlexMeasures to buy flexibility services.


Aggregators
-----------

An Aggregator is a company that has a contractual relationship with Prosumers to provide analytics and planning for their Active Demand & Supply (ADS). By being able to directly control ADS, the Aggregator can sell energy flexibility on the market, sharing revenues with the Prosumer. FlexMeasures allows Aggregators to broker flexibility to Suppliers through an order book.


Energy Service Companies
------------------------

Similar to an Aggregator, an ESCo is a company that has a contractual relationship with Prosumers to provide analytics and planning for their Active Demand & Supply (ADS). Unlike Aggregators, an ESCo does not bring flexibility to the market. Instead it provides optimisation services for behind the meter. Implicit demand response (DR) happens when ESCos are optimising ADS against market prices (wholesale or retail). FlexMeasures supports implicit DR by providing ESCos with visualisation, data storage and API services for timeseries data of market prices.

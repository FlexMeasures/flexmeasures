## Implementing Device-Level Power Constraints as Sensors

The new feature introduced in PR #897 allows the definition of device-level power constraints as sensors. This section outlines practical implementation steps for applying this feature to various use cases:

### Use Case 1: Modeling Device Availability

#### Scenario:
We want to model the availability of a device, such as an industrial process or an Electric Vehicle (EV), based on its power constraints.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Identify Power Constraints:**
   - Define the specific power constraints that affect the availability of the device. These could include maximum and minimum power limits.

2. **Configure Power Constraints as Sensors:**
   - Within the system, define these power constraints as sensors associated with the device.
   - Establish a mechanism to monitor and interpret these sensor values to determine device availability based on the defined constraints.

3. **Usage Example:**
   - Implement a module that checks the sensor values representing power constraints. Based on these values, indicate the device's availability status within the system.

### Use Case 2: Modeling Dynamic Power Limits due to Temperature

#### Scenario:
We aim to model dynamic power limits for devices, such as power lines, influenced by external temperature changes.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Understand Temperature-Related Power Limits:**
   - Research and identify how temperature affects power limits, similar to dynamic line ratings for electric utilities.

2. **Map Temperature Sensing to Power Constraints:**
   - Implement temperature sensors within the system, capable of tracking temperature variations.
   - Associate these temperature sensor values with power constraints for devices affected by temperature changes.

3. **Adapt Power Constraints Based on Temperature:**
   - Create algorithms or rules that dynamically adjust the device's power constraints based on the real-time temperature sensor readings.
   
4. **Application Example:**
   - Develop a module that continuously checks temperature sensor values and adapts the device's power constraints accordingly to reflect dynamic changes in the system.

### Use Case 3: Grid Congestion Management

#### Scenario:
We want to manage grid congestion by limiting the charging power of Electric Vehicles (EVs) during specific periods.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Define Grid Congestion Parameters:**
   - Determine the criteria for identifying grid congestion periods that require limitation of charging power for EVs or other devices.

2. **Create Charging Power Limitation Rules:**
   - Establish rules or conditions within the system that trigger limitations on the charging power of devices during identified congestion periods.

3. **Implementation Example:**
   - Develop a module that monitors grid congestion parameters and enforces charging power limitations on EVs or selected devices based on predefined rules.

### Use Case 4: Setting Precise Power Profiles for Devices

#### Scenario:
We aim to set very close maximum and minimum power limits to enforce a specific power profile with a narrow margin for a device.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Define Narrow Margin Power Constraints:**
   - Define power constraints with maximum and minimum limits set very close together to create a narrow margin for the device's power profile.

2. **Enforce Specific Power Profile:**
   - Implement mechanisms that ensure the device operates within the predefined narrow margin power constraints.

3. **Application Instance:**
   - Develop a control system that monitors and adjusts the device's operations to stay within the narrow margin power constraints, ensuring adherence to the specified power profile.

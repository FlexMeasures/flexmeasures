v0.8.0 | January 24, 2022
===========================

.. warning:: Upgrading to this version requires running ``flexmeasures db upgrade`` (you can create a backup first with ``flexmeasures db-ops dump``).
.. warning:: In case you use FlexMeasures for simulations using ``FLEXMEASURES_MODE = "play"``, allowing to overwrite data is now set separately using  :ref:`overwrite-config`. Add ``FLEXMEASURES_ALLOW_DATA_OVERWRITE = True`` to your config settings to keep the old behaviour.
.. note:: v0.8.0 is doing much of the work we need to do to move to the new data model (see :ref:`note_on_datamodel_transition`). We hope to keep the migration steps for users very limited. One thing you'll notice is that we are copying over existing data to the new model (which will be kept in sync) with the `db upgrade` command (see warning above), which can take a few minutes.

New features
-----------
* Bar charts of sensor data for individual sensors, that can be navigated using a calendar [see `PR #99 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/99>`_ and `PR #290 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/290>`_]

* Mobile friendly (responsive) charts of sensor data, and such charts can be requested with a custom width and height [see `PR #313 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/313>`_]
* Schedulers take into account round-trip efficiency if set [see `PR #291 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/291>`_]
* Schedulers take into account min/max state of charge if set [see `PR #325 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/325>`_]
* Fallback policies for charging schedules of batteries and Charge Points, in cases where the solver is presented with an infeasible problem [see `PR #267 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/267>`_ and `PR #270 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/270>`_]

.. note:: Read more on these features on `the FlexMeasures blog <https://flexmeasures.io/080-better-scheduling-safer-data/>`__.

Deprecations

* Set bar width of bar charts based on sensor resolution [see `PR #310 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/310>`_]
* Fix bug in sensor data charts where data from multiple sources would be stacked, which incorrectly suggested that the data should be summed, whereas the data represents alternative beliefs [see `PR #228 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/228>`_]

Infrastructure / Support
----------------------
* Account-based authorization, incl. new decorators for endpoints [see `PR #210 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/210>`_]
* Central authorization policy which lets database models codify who can do what (permission-based) and relieve API endpoints from this [see `PR #234 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/234>`_]
* Improve data specification for forecasting models using timely-beliefs data [see `PR #154 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/154>`_]
* Properly attribute Mapbox and OpenStreetMap [see `PR #292 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/292>`_]
* Allow plugins to register their custom config settings, so that FlexMeasures can check whether they are set up correctly [see `PR #230 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/230>`_ and `PR #237 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/237>`_]
* Add sensor method to obtain just its latest state (excl. forecasts) [see `PR #235 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/235>`_]

* Support the new asset model (which describes the organisational structure, rather than sensors and data) in UI and API. Until the transition to our new data model is completed, the new API for assets is at `/api/dev/generic_assets`. [see `PR #251 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/251>`_ and `PR #290 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pulls/290>`_]
* Internal search methods return most recent beliefs by default, also for charts, which can make them load a lot faster [see `PR #307 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/307>`_ and `PR #312 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/312>`_]
* Support unit conversion for posting sensor data [see `PR #283 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/283>`_ and `PR #293 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/293>`_]
* Improve the core device scheduler to support dealing with asymmetric efficiency losses of individual devices, and with asymmetric up and down prices for deviating from previous commitments (such as a different feed-in tariff) [see `PR #291 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/291>`_]
* Stop automatically triggering forecasting jobs when API calls save nothing new to the database, thereby saving redundant computation [see `PR #303 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/303>`_]


v0.7.1 | November 8, 2021
===========================

Bugfixes
-----------

* Fix ``sensors/<id>/chart`` view [see `PR #223 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/223>`_]

Infrastructure / Support
----------------------
* FlexMeasures plugins can be Python packages now. We provide `a cookie-cutter template <https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures-plugin-template>`_ for this approach. [see `PR #182 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/182>`_]
* Set default timezone for new users using the FLEXMEASURES_TIMEZONE config setting [see `PR #190 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/190>`_]

Infrastructure / Support
----------------------


v0.6.0 | September 3, 2021
===========================

.. warning:: Upgrading to this version requires running ``flexmeasures db upgrade`` (you can create a backup first with ``flexmeasures db-ops dump``).
             In case you are using experimental developer features and have previously set up sensors, be sure to check out the upgrade instructions in `PR #157 <https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/157>`_. Furthermore, if you want to create custom user/account relationships while upgrading (otherwise the upgrade script creates accounts based on email domains), check out the upgrade instructions in `PR #159 <https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/159>`_. If you want to use both of these custom upgrade features, do the upgrade in two steps. First, as described in PR 157 and upgrading up to revision b6d49ed7cceb, then as described in PR 159 for the rest.

.. warning:: The config setting ``FLEXMEASURES_LISTED_VIEWS`` has been renamed to ``FLEXMEASURES_MENU_LISTED_VIEWS``.

.. warning:: Plugins now need to set their version on their module rather than on their blueprint. See the `documentation for writing plugins <https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.0/dev/plugins.html>`_.

New features
-----------
* Multi-tenancy: Supporting multiple customers per FlexMeasures server, by introducing the `Account` concept. Accounts have users and assets associated.

* Analytics view offers grouping of all assets by location [see `PR #148 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/148>`_]
* Add (experimental) endpoint to post sensor data for any sensor. Also supports our ongoing integration with data internally represented using the `timely beliefs <https://github.com/SeitaBV/timely-beliefs>`_ lib [see `PR #147 <http://www.github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/147>`_]

.. note:: Read more on these features on `the FlexMeasures blog <https://flexmeasures.io/v060-multi-tenancy-error-monitoring/>`__.

* The experimental parts of the data model can now be visualised, as well, via `make show-data-model` (add the --dev option in Makefile) [also in `PR #157 <https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/157>`_]


v0.5.0 | June 7, 2021
===========================

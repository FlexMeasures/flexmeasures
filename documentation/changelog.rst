v0.6.0 | September 3, 2021
===========================

.. warning:: Upgrading to this version requires running ``flexmeasures db upgrade`` (you can create a backup first with ``flexmeasures db-ops dump``).
             In case you are using experimental developer features and have previously set up sensors, be sure to check out the upgrade instructions in `PR #157 <https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/157>`_. Furthermore, if you want to create custom user/account relationships while upgrading (otherwise the upgrade script creates accounts based on email domains), check out the upgrade instructions in `PR #159 <https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/159>`_. If you want to use both of these custom upgrade features, do the upgrade in two steps. First, as described in PR 157 and upgrading up to revision b6d49ed7cceb, then as described in PR 159 for the rest.

.. warning:: The config setting ``FLEXMEASURES_LISTED_VIEWS`` has been renamed to ``FLEXMEASURES_MENU_LISTED_VIEWS``.

.. warning:: Plugins now need to set their version on their module rather than on their blueprint. See the `documentation for writing plugins <https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.0/dev/plugins.html>`_.

New features
-----------
* Multi-tenancy: Supporting multiple customers per FlexMeasures server, by introducing the `Account` concept. Accounts have users and assets associated. [see `PR #159 <http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/159>`_ and `PR #163 <http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/163>`_]
* In the UI, the root view ("/"), the platform name and the visible menu items can now be more tightly controlled (per account roles of the current user) [see also `PR #163 <http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/163>`_]
* Analytics view offers grouping of all assets by location [see `PR #148 <http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/148>`_]
* Add (experimental) endpoint to post sensor data for any sensor. Also supports our ongoing integration with data internally represented using the `timely beliefs <https://github.com/SeitaBV/timely-beliefs>`_ lib [see `PR #147 <http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/147>`_]

.. note:: Read more on these features on `the FlexMeasures blog <https://flexmeasures.io/v060-multi-tenancy-error-monitoring/>`__.

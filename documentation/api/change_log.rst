API change log
===============

v2.0 | 2021-04-02
"""""""""""""""""

- [**Breaking change**] Switched the interpretation of horizons to rolling horizons.
- [**Breaking change**] Deprecated the use of ISO 8601 repeating time intervals to denote rolling horizons.
- [**Breaking change**] Deprecated the automatic inference of horizons for *postMeterData*, *postPrognosis*, *postPriceData* and *postWeatherData* endpoints for API version below v2.0.
- Introduced the "prior" field for *postMeterData*, *postPrognosis*, *postPriceData* and *postWeatherData* endpoints.
- Changed the Introduction section:

    - Rewrote the subsection on prognoses to explain the horizon and prior fields.

- Changed the Simulation section:

    - Rewrote relevant examples using horizon and prior fields.

v2.0 | 2021-02-19
"""""""""""""""""""

- REST endpoints for managing users: `/users/` (GET), `/user/<id>` (GET, PATCH) and `/user/<id>/password-reset` (PATCH).

v2.0 | 2020-11-14
"""""""""""""""""""

- REST endpoints for managing assets: `/assets/` (GET, POST) and `/asset/<id>` (GET, PATCH, DELETE).

v1.3-7 | 2020-12-16
"""""""""""""""""""

*Affects all versions since v1.0*.

- Separated the dual purpose of the "horizon" field in the *getMeterData* and *getPrognosis* endpoints by introducing the "prior" field:

    - The "horizon" field in GET endpoints is now always interpreted as a rolling horizon, regardless of whether it is stated as an ISO 8601 repeating time interval.
    - The *getMeterData* and *getPrognosis* endpoints now accept an optional "prior" field to select only data recorded before a certain ISO 8601 timestamp (replacing the unintuitive usage of the horizon field for specifying a latest time of belief).

v1.3-6 | 2020-12-11
"""""""""""""""""""

*Affects all versions since v1.0*.

- The *getMeterData* and *getPrognosis* endpoints now return the INVALID_SOURCE status 400 response in case the optional "source" field is used and no relevant sources can be found.

v1.3-5 | 2020-10-29
"""""""""""""""""""

*Affects all versions since v1.0*.

- Endpoints to POST meter data will now check incoming data to see if the required asset's resolution is being used ― upsampling is done if possible.
  These endpoints can now return the REQUIRED_INFO_MISSING status 400 response.
- Endpoints to GET meter data will return data in the asset's resolution ― downsampling to the "resolution" field is done if possible.
- As they need to determine the asset, all of the mentioned POST and GET endpoints can now return the UNRECOGNIZED_ASSET status 4000 response.

v1.3-4 | 2020-06-18
"""""""""""""""""""

- Improved support for use cases of the *getDeviceMessage* endpoint in which a longer duration, between posting UDI events and retrieving device messages based on those UDI events, is required; the default *time to live* of UDI event identifiers is prolonged from 500 seconds to 7 days, and can be set as a config variable (`FLEXMEASURES_PLANNING_TTL`)

v1.3-3 | 2020-06-07
"""""""""""""""""""

- Changed backend support (API specifications unaffected) for scheduling charging stations to scheduling Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), in accordance with the Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI).

v1.3-2 | 2020-03-11
"""""""""""""""""""

- Fixed example entity addresses in simulation section


v1.3-1 | 2020-02-08
"""""""""""""""""""

- Backend change: the default planning horizon can now be set in FlexMeasures's configuration (`FLEXMEASURES_PLANNING_HORIZON`)

v1.3-0 | 2020-01-28
"""""""""""""""""""

- Introduced new event type "soc-with-targets" to support scheduling charging stations (see extra example for the *postUdiEvent* endpoint)
- The *postUdiEvent* endpoint now triggers scheduling jobs to be set up (rather than scheduling directly triggered by the *getDeviceMessage* endpoint)
- The *getDeviceMessage* now queries the job queue and database for an available schedule

v1.2-3 | 2020-01-28
"""""""""""""""""""

- Updated endpoint descriptions with additional possible status 400 responses:

    - INVALID_DOMAIN for invalid entity addresses
    - UNKNOWN_PRICES for infeasible schedules due to missing prices

v1.2-2 | 2018-10-08
"""""""""""""""""""

- Added a list of registered types of weather sensors to the Simulation section and *postWeatherData* endpoint
- Changed example for the *postPriceData* endpoint to reflect Korean situation

    }

    rather than the erroneously double-keyed:

    {
        "type": "PostUdiEventRequest",
        "event": "ea1.2018-06.io.flexmeasures.company:7:10:203",

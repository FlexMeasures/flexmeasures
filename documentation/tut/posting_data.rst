Posting data
============

The platform FlexMeasures strives on the data you feed it. Let's demonstrate how you can get data into FlexMeasures using the API. This is where FlexMeasures gets connected to your system as a smart backend and helps you build smart energy services.

We will show how to use the API endpoints for POSTing data.
You can call these at regular intervals (through scheduled scripts in your system, for example), so that FlexMeasures always has recent data to work with.
Of course, these endpoints can also be used to load historic data into FlexMeasures, so that the forecasting models have access to enough data history.

.. note:: For the purposes of forecasting and scheduling, it is often advisable to use a less fine-grained resolution than most metering services keep. For example, while such services might measure every ten seconds, FlexMeasures will usually do its job no less effective if you feed it data with a resolution of five minutes. This will also make the data integration much easier. Keep in mind that many data sources like weather forecasting or markets can have data resolutions of an hour, anyway.

Prerequisites
--------------

- FlexMeasures needs some structural meta data for data to be understood. For example, for adding weather data we need to define a weather sensor, and what kind of weather sensors there are. You also need a user account. If you host FlexMeasures yourself, you need to add this info first. Head over to :ref:`getting_started`, where these steps are covered, study our :ref:`cli` or look into plugins which do this like `flexmeasures-entsoe <https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures-entsoe>`_ or `flexmeasures-openweathermap <https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures-openweathermap>`_.
- You should be familiar with where to find your API endpoints (see :ref:`api_versions`) and how to authenticate against the API (see :ref:`api_auth`).

.. note:: For deeper explanations of the data and the meta fields we'll send here, You can always read the :ref:`api_introduction`, to the FlexMeasures API, e.g. :ref:`signs`, :ref:`resolutions`, :ref:`prognoses` and :ref:`units`.

.. note:: To address assets and sensors, these tutorials assume entity addresses valid in the namespace ``fm1``. See :ref:`api_introduction` for more explanations. 


Posting price data
------------------

Price data (both observations and forecasts) can be posted to `POST  /api/v2_0/postPriceData <../api/v2_0.html#post--api-v2_0-postPriceData>`_. The URL might look like this:

.. code-block:: html

    https://company.flexmeasures.io/api/<version>/postPriceData

This example "PostPriceDataRequest" message posts prices for hourly intervals between midnight and midnight the next day
for the Korean Power Exchange (KPX) day-ahead auction, registered under sensor 16.
The ``prior`` indicates that the prices were published at 3pm on December 31st 2014 (i.e. the clearing time of the KPX day-ahead market, which is at 3 PM on the previous day â€• see below for a deeper explanation).

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "type": "PostPriceDataRequest",
        "market": "ea1.2021-01.io.flexmeasures.company:fm1.16",
        "values": [
            52.37,
            51.14,
            49.09,

            69.21,
            70.26,
            70.46,
            70,
            70.7,
            70.41,
            70,
            64.53,
            65.92,
            69.72,
            70.51,
            75.49,
            70.35,
            70.01,
            66.98,
            58.61
        ],
        "start": "2015-01-01T00:00:00+09:00",
        "duration": "PT24H",
        "prior": "2014-12-31T15:00:00+09:00",
        "unit": "KRW/kWh"
    }

Note how the resolution of the data comes out at 60 minutes when you divide the duration by the number of data points.
If this resolution does not match the sensor's resolution, FlexMeasures will try to upsample the data to make the match or, if that is not possible, complain.


Posting power data
------------------

For power data, USEF specifies separate message types for observations and forecasts.
Correspondingly, FlexMeasures uses separate endpoints to communicate these messages.
Observations of power data can be posted to `POST /api/v2_0/postMeterData <../api/v2_0.html#post--api-v2_0-postMeterData>`_. The URL might look like this:

.. code-block:: html

    https://company.flexmeasures.io/api/<version>/postMeterData

while forecasts of power data can be posted to `POST /api/v2_0/postPrognosis <../api/v2_0.html#post--api-v2_0-postPrognosis>`_. The URL might look like this:

.. code-block:: html

    https://company.flexmeasures.io/api/<version>/postPrognosis

For both endpoints, power data can be posted in various ways.
The following examples assume that the endpoint for power data observations (i.e. meter data) is used.

.. todo:: For the time being, only one rate unit (MW) can be used to post power values.


Single value, single connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A single average power value for a 15-minute time interval for a single connection, posted 5 minutes after realisation.

        "unit": "MW"
    }

Multiple values, single connection

        "unit": "MW"
    }


.. _observations_vs_forecasts

Observations vs forecasts
--------------------------

To correctly tell FlexMeasures when a meter reading or forecast was known is crucial, as it determines which data is being used to compute schedules or to make other forecasts.

Usually, the time of posting is assumed to be the time when the data was known. But you can also explicitly tell FlexMeasures what these times are. This either works with one fixed time (for the whole set of data being sent) or with a horizon (which applies to each data point separately).

E.g. to post a forecast rather than an observation after the fact, simply set the ``prior`` to the moment at which the forecasts were made, e.g. at "2015-01-01T16:30:00+09:00". Assuming your data starts at 5.00pm, this denotes that the data are forecasts, made half an hour before realisation.

Alternatively, to indicate that each individual observation was made directly after the end of its 15-minute interval (i.e. at 3.15pm, 3.30pm and so on), set a ``horizon`` to "PT0H" instead of a ``prior``.

Finally, delays in reading out sensor data can be simulated by setting the ``horizon`` field to a negative value.
For example, a horizon of "-PT1H" would denote that each temperature reading was observed one hour after the fact (i.e. at 4.15pm, 4.30pm and so on).

See :ref:`prognoses` for more information regarding the ``prior`` and ``horizon`` fields.

A good example for the use of the ``prior`` field are markets, which have clearing times.
For example, at the KPX day-ahead auction this is every day at 3pm.
This point in time (i.e. when contracts are signed) determines the difference between an ex-post observation and an ex-ante forecast.

Another example for the ``prior`` field is running simulations with FlexMeasures. It gives you control over the timing so that you could run a month in the past as if it happened right now.


.. _posting_flex_states:

Posting flexibility states
-------------------------------

There is one more crucial kind of data that FlexMeasures needs to know about: What are the current states of flexible devices? For example, a battery has a state of charge.

The USEF framework defines a so-called "UDI-Event" (UDI stands for Universal Device Interface) to communicate settings for devices with Active Demand & Supply (ADS).
Owners of such devices can post these states to `POST /api/v2_0/postUdiEvent <../api/v2_0.html#post--api-v2_0-postUdiEvent>`_. The URL might look like this:

.. code-block:: html

    https://company.flexmeasures.io/api/<version>/postUdiEvent

This example posts a state of charge value for a battery device (asset 10 of owner 7) as UDI event 203.
From this, FlexMeasures derives the energy flexibility this battery has in the near future.

.. code-block:: json

        {
            "type": "PostUdiEventRequest",
            "event": "ea1.2021-01.io.flexmeasures.company:7:10:203:soc",
            "value": 12.1,
            "datetime": "2015-06-02T10:00:00+00:00",
            "unit": "kWh"
        }

.. note:: At the moment, FlexMeasures only supports batteries and car chargers here (asset types "battery", "one-way_evse" or "two-way_evse").
          This will be expanded to flexible assets as needed.

Actually, UDI Events are more powerful than this. In :ref:`how_queue_scheduling`, we'll cover how they can be used to request a future state, which is useful to steer the scheduling.

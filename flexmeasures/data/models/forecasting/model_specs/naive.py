Naive model, which simply copies the measurement from which the forecasts is made. Useful as a fallback.

Technically, the model has no regressors and just one lag - made using the horizon.
The value to be copied is this one lag.
This is because we assume the forecast is made for the very reason that the data point at this lag exists - why else would one make
a prediction from there with this horizon?

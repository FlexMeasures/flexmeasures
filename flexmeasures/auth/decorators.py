    """
    This decorator can be used to make sure that the current user has the necessary permission to access the context.
    The context needs to be an AuthModelMixin and is found in the keyword arguments by name and/or by a position in the non-keyword arguments (defaults to 0).
    Using both arguments is useful when Marshmallow places a dict of de-serialized fields and you are using use_args.
    The permission needs to be a known permission and is checked with principal descriptions from the context's access control list (see AuthModelMixin.__acl__).

    Usually, you'd place a marshmallow field further up in the decorator chain, e.g.:

        @app.route("/resource/<resource_id>", methods=["GET"])
        @use_kwargs(
            {"the_resource": ResourceIdField(data_key="resource_id")},

        @as_json
        def view(resource_id: int, resource: Resource):
            return dict(name=resource.name)

    Where `ResourceIdField._deserialize()` turns the id parameter into a resource context (if possible).

    This decorator raises a 403 response if there is no principal for the required permission.
    It raises a 401 response if the user is not authenticated at all.

        Trigger FlexMeasures to create a schedule.

        .. :quickref: Schedule; Trigger scheduling job

        Trigger FlexMeasures to create a schedule for this sensor.
        The assumption is that this sensor is the power sensor on a flexible asset.

        In this request, you can describe:

        - the schedule's main features (when does it start, what unit should it report, prior to what time can we assume knowledge)
        - the flexibility model for the sensor (state and constraint variables, e.g. current state of charge of a battery, or connection capacity)
        - the flexibility context which the sensor operates in (other sensors under the same EMS which are relevant, e.g. prices)

        For details on flexibility model and context, see :ref:`describing_flexibility`.
        Below, we'll also list some examples.

        .. note:: This endpoint does not support to schedule an EMS with multiple flexible sensors at once. This will happen in another endpoint.
                  See https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/issues/485. Until then, it is possible to call this endpoint for one flexible endpoint at a time
                  (considering already scheduled sensors as inflexible).

        The length of the schedule can be set explicitly through the 'duration' field.
        Otherwise, it is set by the config setting :ref:`planning_horizon_config`, which defaults to 48 hours.
        If the flex-model contains targets that lie beyond the planning horizon, the length of the schedule is extended to accommodate them.
        Finally, the schedule length is limited by :ref:`max_planning_horizon_config`, which defaults to 2520 steps of the sensor's resolution.
        Targets that exceed the max planning horizon are not accepted.

        The appropriate algorithm is chosen by FlexMeasures (based on asset type).
        It's also possible to use custom schedulers and custom flexibility models, see :ref:`plugin_customization`.

        If you have ideas for algorithms that should be part of FlexMeasures, let us know: https://flexmeasures.io/get-in-touch/

        **Example request A**

        This message triggers a schedule for a storage asset, starting at 10.00am, at which the state of charge (soc) is 12.1 kWh.

        .. code-block:: json

            {
                "start": "2015-06-02T10:00:00+00:00",
                "flex-model": {
                    "soc-at-start": 12.1,
                    "soc-unit": "kWh"
                }
            }

        **Example request B**

        This message triggers a 24-hour schedule for a storage asset, starting at 10.00am,
        at which the state of charge (soc) is 12.1 kWh, with a target state of charge of 25 kWh at 4.00pm.

        The charging efficiency is constant (120%) and the discharging efficiency is determined by the contents of sensor
        with id 98. If just the ``roundtrip-efficiency`` is known, it can be described with its own field.
        The global minimum and maximum soc are set to 10 and 25 kWh, respectively.
        To guarantee a minimum SOC in the period prior to 4.00pm, local minima constraints are imposed (via soc-minima)
        at 2.00pm and 3.00pm, for 15kWh and 20kWh, respectively.
        Storage efficiency is set to 99.99%, denoting the state of charge left after each time step equal to the sensor's resolution.
        Aggregate consumption (of all devices within this EMS) should be priced by sensor 9,
        and aggregate production should be priced by sensor 10,
        where the aggregate power flow in the EMS is described by the sum over sensors 13, 14 and 15
        (plus the flexible sensor being optimized, of course).


        The battery consumption power capacity is limited by sensor 42 and the production capacity is constant (30 kW).

        Note that, if forecasts for sensors 13, 14 and 15 are not available, a schedule cannot be computed.
